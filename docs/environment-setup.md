# Environment Setup

This document describes the Microsoft 365 lab environment used for Microsoft 365 access troubleshooting scenarios documented in this repository.

---

## Tenant Type
- Microsoft 365 Developer tenant  
  *(Used for learning, testing, and portfolio documentation)*

> If using simulations instead of a live tenant, note this here.

---

## Admin Portals Used
- Microsoft 365 Admin Center  
- Microsoft Entra ID Admin Center

---

## Test User Accounts
The following test user accounts were created to simulate real-world access and authentication issues:

- `jordon.user1@<tenant>.onmicrosoft.com`
- `jordon.user2@<tenant>.onmicrosoft.com`

> Usernames are anonymized and used solely for lab-based troubleshooting scenarios.

---

## Authentication & Security Configuration
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled for test users
- Authentication methods configured for testing MFA-related issues
- Security Defaults or Conditional Access policies applied where applicable

---

## Assumptions & Limitations
- All troubleshooting scenarios are performed in a controlled lab environment
- Conditional Access policies may be simulated depending on tenant capabilities
- No production user data or real customer environments are used
- Screenshots are sanitized to remove sensitive information

---

## Purpose of This Environment
This environment is designed to:
- Simulate common Microsoft 365 access issues
- Practice IT Analyst-style troubleshooting workflows
- Document investigation steps, root cause analysis, and resolutions
- Build a portfolio of realistic SaaS access support scenarios
